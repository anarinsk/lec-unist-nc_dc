Have you seen this? 
This is the moment for us.
This photo pops in MLB website on next day of the championship match. 
The sword is 집행검, as reported, the most powerful weapon in game Lineage. 

Recently, we have problem in Korean gaming scenes. I have my opinion on this issues. But, this is not our interest in this lecture. I will skip issues.

# Who am I  
<br>
<br>
## `r icon_rocket()` PhD in Economics (evolutionary game theory)
## `r icon_rocket()` Data Center, Lead (Since 2019)

???

I'm PhD (박사) in Economics. My major research is about evolutionary game theory. NOT game. 
Anyway, game is the key word of my life. 

Now, I'm the lead or head(in Korean English), of Data Center, NCSOFT Korea.

# Today Talk  

### `r icon_rocket()` How game data is collected
### `r icon_rocket()` Three roles of DC
### `r icon_rocket()` Some latest works of DC
### `r icon_rocket()` Q & A (if there is any)

???

Today, topics of my talk has three parts. 

One, I give you some description and explanation of game data, what they are and how they are collected. 

Two, I give you three main roles of Data Center. This is short introdunction to work of data science in companies.  

Three, I tell you some recent issues or research interests of my organization.

Now, when people say Data Center... 

Usually it is hardware infrastructure, like this. Servers, Networks and something.  

hundreds thousands of server. I think you heard AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud. 

In NCSOFT, Data Center is the name of organization. We do not take any hardware-side jobs. Our main mission is to collect and process data from games, to maintain related software platform, and to anlayze data. Please, don't be confused.   

---
# Data Center(DC) of NCSOFT

##  The work of DC includes 
###  `r icon_check()` mananging data and its softwere infra-structure
###  `r icon_check()` doing analytics with data 
###  `r icon_check()` communucating insights & helping decision making.

???
Final one is most important but difficult to do. 
Usaually, insight is out of reach. Your analytics are ignored or loses its original meaning. 
But you should try do better, Because this is the holy grail for data scientists.

# Data Volume of DC


???

I searched in Google, 
How many students, professors and other workers are in your school... 
Google showed me that there are around 5 thousands now.
If we assume that 1 trabyte hard disk for each one, 5 petabyte. 
Data store in NCSOFT is bigger than that.

### 1 Byte = $2^8$ bit 
### 1 KB = $2^{10}$ Byte = 1,024 Byte $\approx$ $10^3$ Byte
### 1 MB = ${\rm 1KB}^2$ = $2^{20}$ KB = 1,048,576 KB $\approx$ $10^{6}$ Byte
### 1 GB = ${\rm 1KB}^3$ =  $2^{30}$ KB = 1,073,741,824 KB $\approx$ $10^{9}$ Byte


???

This is the reason that you see size of your drive is less than the spec. 
The maker of drive shows you decimal capacity. 

But, Windows or computers shows you 1 KB based on binary one Byte.

For example, 
If a disk size is 500 GB in decimal term, its binary capacity is 

$$
\dfrac{500 * 10^9}{2^{30}} = 465.6613.
$$

???
That is to say, For 500 GB in decimal is around 466 GB...

# Questions for You

##`r icon_comment()` What is (Big) Data?

--
##`r icon_comment()` Think any data you've handled. 

--
##`r icon_comment()` How big is big?

--
##`r icon_comment()` Can you define data of any kind? 

???
Think, for a moment. Imagine your data experiences....
I may be wrong, but files like Excel or Excel-like data (CSV) looks familiar.

Your first data analytics may start with excel-like ones. 

Unfortunately, if your have such a good organized data, you are almost at the end of the finish line. 

---
# Data May Be A Pile of 'Garbage...'
<br>
###  `r icon_check()` Usually data are not (cannot be) so *clean*. 
###  `r icon_check()` Something organized or tabulated &rarr; You got the picture of data. 
###  `r icon_check()` Big data are generally unorganized, unstructured, and messy.

Actually, most of data in today's world are in both world.

### The other side of playing 

???

For online games, your play should be transmitted to the server you joined. 

The results of game playing are being record continuously. 

This record tracks your history including gains, losses, fights and cooperation among players.

Side questions. 

How many servers are there in 리니지M? 

Tell me your guess. 

Now there are around 150 servers at work.

# DC as A Data Janitor
<br>
##  `r icon_rocket()` Think what a janitor does.
###  `r icon_check()` All of janitor jobs are about preparing something for the work 
###  `r icon_check()` Any automated system cannot process log without human effort.
###  `r icon_check()` Around 90% of data works is janitor jobs.   

???
Let’s on this. I used ‘janitor’ instead of data scientist, data engineer.
Because, cleaning job is really dirty and toiling

---
# What Data Engineers do in DC 
<br>
### `r icon_rocket()` Managing our custom Hadoop system
### `r icon_rocket()` Developing data tools and services 
### `r icon_rocket()` Operating day-to-day data stream  


???
Have you heard on Hadoop? 
Hadoop is one of standards in bigdata technology. It is open source. But to utilize the power of the Hadoop, a tons of research and effort is needed. 

We also develops in-house tools and services customized for our game services. 

Data should be managed in ecosystems. So operation is important. Each part get ready to guarantee the whole system work smoothly.

##  1. Metrics 
##  2. Visualization 


???

Two areas are big issue to talk each other deeply. 

Today, I'm going to touch the surface of the first. 

We have a limited time. 

---
# Metrics Frequently Used
<br>
### `r icon_rocket()` AU = Active Users 
### `r icon_rocket()` ARPU = Average Revenue Per User 
### `r icon_rocket()` ARPPU = Average Revenue Per Paying User 
### `r icon_rocket()` CLV = Customer's Life-time Value 

???
CLV is yard stick or reference point of marketing. 
For example, if CLV is larger than the cost of attracting one player, market is profitable. Otherwise, market is not.

Unique features for game make game analytivcs so special?

### `r icon_rocket()` Because bugs can be devastating...

???

In virtual world, game, small loophole, bug, and other unknown problems can do much much bigger damage on the service. 

So, we must detect them as soon as possible. (ASAP)

##  `r icon_rocket()` There is no *magic* called MACHINE LEARNING.

Some say that machine is final and ultimate solution. 

But, many problem are need human intelligence. something Automated is not enough.

# When Experimentation Is Not An Option 
<br>
###  `r icon_rocket()` A/B test is widely used to optimize many services
###  `r icon_rocket()` In social events, A/B test is often controversial. 
#####  &nbsp; `r icon_check()` Consider Covid-19 vaccine A/B test.
###  `r icon_rocket()` Statistical methods on observational data are useful. 

???
A/B Test is statistical technique for picking an exact reason that make something happen. When We say A and B, A and B is almost same in every respect except one thing. 
So, If A is diffrent from B, that comes from the one thing different. 

Originally, A/B Test is usual tools for medical test. But in Social sciences, applying A/B test can be difficult. For example, think about Covid-19 vaccine test. For A group, we give real vaccine. For B, we give fake one. There may be ethical issue.

This question is just like that: 

If you are lottery winner, do you spend more on something? 

This is not easy question, because many other factors or something get in the way. Usually we cannot pick out that factor exactly.
