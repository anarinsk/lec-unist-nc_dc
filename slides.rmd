Have you seen this? 
This is the moment for our company. 
This photo pops in MLB website on next day of the championship match. 
The sword is 집행검, as reported, the most powerful weapon in Lineage series. 
A person talked The model 집행검 is expensive, but they didn't know that virtual 집행검 is much more expensive than the real one. 
What's your guess of the price? There was a record that 집행검 is traded by more than 50 T USD.

I'm PhD in Economics. My major reseach is about evolutionary game theory. NOT game. 
Anyway, game is the key word of my life. 

Now, I'm the lead or head(in Korean English), of Data Center, NCSOFT Korea.

# Today Talk  

### &thinsp; `r icon_rocket()` How game data is collected
### &thinsp; `r icon_rocket()` Three roles of DC
### &thinsp; `r icon_rocket()` Some nudges for you
### &thinsp; `r icon_rocket()` Q & A (if there is any)

???

Today, topics of my talk has three parts. 

One, I give you some description of game data, what and how they are collected. 

Two, I give you three main roles of DC. 

Three, I give you three recommendation if you are interested in working as data scientists or data engineers or whatever data jobs.

# Data Volume of DC


???

I searched in Google, 

How many students and professors are in your school... 

Google told me the number around 5 thousands.

If we assume that 1 Terabyte hard disk for each one, 

Data store in NCSOFT is bigger than that.

This is the reason that you see size of your drive is less than the spec. 

The maker of drive shows you decimal capacity. 

But, Windows shows you 1 KB based on binary 1 Byte. 

That is to say, 

For 1 TB in decimal is around 976GB...

# Data May Be A Pile of 'Garbage...'

### &thinsp; `r icon_check()` Usually data are not (cannot be) so *clean*. 
### &thinsp; `r icon_check()` Something organized or tabulated &rarr; You got the picture of data. 
### &thinsp; `r icon_check()` Big data are generally unorganized, unstructured, and messy.

For online games, your play should be transmitted to the server you joined. 

The results of game playing record continuously via pre-defined format. 

This record tracks your history, gains, losses, fights and cooperation among players of your play.

Side questions. 

How many servers are there in 리니지M?

# What Data Engineers do in DC

### &emsp; `r icon_rocket()` Managing our custom Hadoop system
### &emsp; `r icon_rocket()` Developing data tools and services 
### &emsp; `r icon_rocket()` Operating day-to-day data stream

Hadoop is one of standards in bigdata technology. It is open source. But to utilize the power of the Hadoop, a tons of research and effort is needed. 

We also develops inhouse tools and services customized for our game services. 

Data should be managed in ecosystems. So operation is important. Each part get ready to guarantee the whole system work smoothly.
